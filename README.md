# Welcome to My Dropbox
Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software.


## Task
My task is to implement a file management system that allows users to sign up for an account and be able to upload and share files to the application.

## Description
I used AWS amplify along with an S3 bucket as my backend. The frontend was built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
[Deployed Project](https://mikebox.mikerock.tech/)

## Installation
- First you need to configure your amplify backend and create a storage bucket.
- Then you can run npm start, which will spin up an local server on port 3000.
- Visit http://localhost:3000 on your browser to view page

## Usage
- Visit https://mikebox.mikerock.tech/
- Create a new account account
- Sign in with your username password
- On the Dashboard click on upload file button to create a new file.
- To create a new folder and enter the folder name.
- Files are uploaded to the root directory (/) by default
- To upload to a differrent folder, navigate to the target folder and upload from there.
- Click on the menu icon on the file/folder card to display more options
